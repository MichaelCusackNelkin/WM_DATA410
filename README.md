## DATA 410

This is a repository holding my work for my undergraduate data science capstone course, Advanced Applied Machine Learning. Below are descriptions of each folder. Projects for this course included:
- A comparison of LOESS and Random Forests on housing data. 
- An investigation of multivariate regression analysis and gradient boosting with LOESS and XGB.
- A comparison of boosting algorithms including Microsoft's light gradient boosting machines (LightGBM)
- Learning about regularization and variable selection with Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, Square Root Lasso, and SCAD.

### Code
This folder contains lecture materials form teh coursework portion of this course. We learning about how to apply different machine learning techniques, how to improve them with hyperparameter tuning, and about the mathematics underpinning what we were applying.

### Deprecated
This folder contains old and outdated code.

### Final Project
Here lies my undergraduate data science capstone, at Final_Project_WriteUp.html

### For_Fun
This is a few tutorials I worked through while an undergraduate.

### Projects
This contains my completed projects in this course.
